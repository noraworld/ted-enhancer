## Features
### Comprehensive translation by DeepL
If the video you want to watch offers some subtitles, it can translate it into your preferred language, **even if the video doesn't support the language**.

### Displaying the original subtitle and the translated subtitle simultaneously
Translation works **in real-time**.

### Ability to show and hide the subtitles
This is useful when you would like to see if you can understand what the speaker says **without the subtitles**.

### Repetitive playback of the same line
It would help when you try to do **shadowing or overlapping**.

### Keyboard full-support
Every function is manipulable as **keyboard shortcuts**.

## Installation
_Stay tuned!_
